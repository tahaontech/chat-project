# Chat Project - React and Node.js Chat Engine

![Chat Project Demo](https://example.com/chat-project-demo.gif)

This project is a chat application built using React and Node.js with the Chat Engine library. It allows users to communicate with each other in real-time through a chat interface. This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to set it up and run it locally.

**I am planning to develop the chat engine from scratch myself.**

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following requirements installed on your system:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- React (v16.8 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-project.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd chat-project
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure the necessary environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and provide the following values:

```
REACT_APP_CHAT_ENGINE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
REACT_APP_CHAT_ENGINE_KEY=YOUR_CHAT_ENGINE_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` and `YOUR_CHAT_ENGINE_KEY` with your Chat Engine project ID and key. You can obtain these credentials by creating an account on the [Chat Engine](https://www.chatengine.io/) website.

## Running the Application

To run the application locally, execute the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can sign up for an account and log in. After logging in, you will be able to join existing chat rooms or create new ones. You can send and receive messages in real-time, view chat history, and manage your user profile.

Feel free to explore and customize the code to add more features or improve the existing functionality.
